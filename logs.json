            "Most interesting to me about Thorogood is the emphasis on providing cutting-edge data and analytics solutions and the strong balance between business acumen and technical knowledge. Being a data enthusiast who loves to use data to extract insights and facilitate informed decision-making, I am attracted to the potential of collaborating with clients across different industries and addressing real-world challenges. Thorogood's blue-chip customer base reflects the confidence and respect that the company has gained in the analytics market. Having the potential to be part of such projects inspires me to be a member of this dynamic group.\n\nLastly, I value Thorogood's formal training and induction process. The organization's investment in developing its people\u2014mentorship, continuous learning, and open development path\u2014is greatly valued by me. The emphasis on teamwork, collaboration, and knowledge sharing constructs a strong support network where one can develop to be a good consultant. I also value the fact that the new entrants are entrusted with responsibilities promptly in order to establish confidence and leadership at an early point.\n\nMy aim in my first year of work at Thorogood is to become a generalist consultant who is proficient in technical delivery and client interaction. I shall begin by learning to the fullest of the training modules and skill up in tools such as Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and cloud platforms. I also wish to enhance my ability to map business needs into data solutions and deliver them through client projects. I will make sure to seek feedback from peers and mentors, reflect on how I have come this far, and engage actively in in-house initiatives. I will try to ask questions, provide input where I can with my expertise, and keep growing with new challenges. Most importantly, I hope to be a good team player, develop long-term relationships, and carry through on the values and quality that Thorogood is known for. I hope my first year is not just an induction, but the beginning of a rich and fulfilling career.",

            "Typographical considerations\r\nProfessionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should \"Set opening paragraphs flush left.\"[2] Bringhurst explains as follows:\r\n\r\nThe function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Elements of Typographic Style states that \"at least one en [space]\" should be used to indent paragraphs after the first,[2] noting that that is the \"practical minimum\".[3] An em space is the most commonly used paragraph indent.[3] Miles Tinker, in his book Legibility of Print, concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases readability by 7%, on average.[4]\r\n\r\nWhen referencing a paragraph, typographic symbol U+00A7 \u00a7 SECTION SIGN (&sect;) may be used: \"See \u00a7 Background\".\r\n\r\nIn modern usage, paragraph initiation is typically indicated by one or more of a preceding blank line, indentation, an \"Initial\" (\"drop cap\") or other indication. Historically, the pilcrow symbol (\u00b6) was used in Latin and western European languages. Other languages have their own marks with similar function.\r\n\r\nWidows and orphans occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.\r\n\r\nIn computing\r\nSee also: Newline\r\nIn word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical white space or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.\r\n\r\nHow such documents are actually stored depends on the file format. For example, HTML uses the <p> tag as a paragraph container. In plaintext files, there are two common formats. The pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line. An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.\r\n\r\nA line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in prose. HTML's <br /> tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the W3C recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each \"paragraph\" is a stanza), or in a street address.[5]\r\n\r\nNumbering\r\nMain article: Dot-decimal notation\r\nSee also: ISO 2145\r\nParagraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 A Course of Modern Analysis, chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter \u00a79.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following section \u00a79.61 treats an associated function, following \u00a79.62 some properties of that function, following \u00a79.621 a related lemma, while \u00a79.63 introduces Riemann's main theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to Giuseppe Peano on their \"Contents\" page, although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere.[6] Gradshteyn and Ryzhik is another book using this scheme since its third edition in 1951.\r\n\r\nSection breaks\r\nMain article: Section (typography)\r\nMany published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain a special symbol known as a dinkus, a fleuron, or a stylistic dingbat.\r\n\r\nStyle advice\r\nThe crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate. The form varies among different types of writing. For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks.\r\n\r\nA common English usage misconception is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.[7]\r\n\r\nEnglish students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a topic sentence or \"main idea\", preferably first, and multiple \"supporting\" or \"detail\" sentences that explain or supply evidence. One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, is known as the Schaffer paragraph. Topic sentences are largely a phenomenon of school-based writing, and the convention does not necessarily obtain in other contexts.[8] This advice is also culturally specific, for example, it differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese (translated as danraku \u6bb5\u843d).[9]",
            "Good paragraphs begin with a topic sentence that briefly explains what the paragraph is about. Next come a few sentences for development and support, elaborating on the topic with more detail. Paragraphs end with a conclusion sentence that summarizes the topic or presents one final piece of support to wrap up."
